🚀 Day 2 - System Design & Integration: Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025

Welcome to Day 2 of my Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025 journey! 🎉 Today, I focused on creating a robust system architecture, detailing how the frontend connects with the backend, and integrating third-party APIs to enhance functionality.

🔧 System Design Overview

The system is structured to ensure scalability and seamless interaction between components. This will deliver users a smooth and dynamic shopping experience. Below is the planned system design:

🔗 Frontend-Backend Integration

Frontend Framework:

Built with Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS, complemented by a component library such as ShadCn UI.

State Management: Handled with Redux to manage complex application states effectively.

Backend:

Developed using Sanity.io as the primary CMS and database, with custom API routes for communication.

Communication:

The frontend interacts with the backend via RESTful API endpoints using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

🌐 Third-Party API Integration

To enhance marketplace functionality, third-party APIs are integrated into the platform.

Purpose:

Payment processing and live product availability updates.

Integration Flow:

The frontend sends requests to the backend.

The backend processes these requests, interacts with the third-party API, and retrieves data.

Responses are sent back to the frontend for display.

Security Measures:

All communication uses HTTPS.

API access is secured with key-based authentication.

📊 API Routes Definition

Here’s a breakdown of the API routes and their respective functions:

GET /api/products: Retrieves a list of available products.

POST /api/order: Creates a new order and processes payment through the third-party API.

GET /api/order/:id: Fetches details of a specific order by its ID.

PUT /api/order/:id: Updates the status of an order (e.g., "Shipped" or "Delivered").

GET /api/payment/verify: Confirms payment status via the third-party API.

💡 Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Zustand for local state management.

Backend: Sanity.io for database and API route handling.

Third-Party API: Integration for payment processing and inventory updates.

Authentication: Secured using Clerk for user login and transaction safety.

📃 Documenting the Workflow

The flow of data across components is outlined as follows:

The frontend sends requests to the backend via defined API routes.

The backend processes the requests, interacts with the third-party API, and sends the results back to the frontend.

The frontend updates the user interface based on the backend responses.

📊 Visual Data Structure

A detailed diagram illustrating the system’s data structure and interactions will be created to guide implementation. https://app.eraser.io/workspace/f8RoeSaW7UznSzcoHsup?origin=share

🔒 Next Steps

Moving forward, I’ll focus on:

Developing the API routes.

Integrating the third-party APIs for payment and product updates.

Starting the frontend development to connect and visualize all components.

🚀 Day 2 Summary

Today’s efforts laid the foundation for a fully functional and integrated marketplace. With the system design and integration plan ready, the next phase will turn these designs into reality. Stay tuned for updates!
